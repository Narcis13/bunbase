# Milestone v0.1 Audit Report

**Project:** BunBase - PocketBase alternative built with Bun
**Milestone:** v0.1 MVP
**Audited:** 2026-01-26
**Status:** PASSED

## Executive Summary

All 44 requirements satisfied. All 8 phases verified. Cross-phase integration complete with 28 connected exports. All 5 E2E flows verified working. Minor tech debt identified (TypeScript type issues, 2 orphaned exports).

**Recommendation:** Proceed with milestone completion.

## Requirements Coverage

| Category | Count | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Schema (SCHM) | 13/13 | ✓ Complete |
| API | 9/9 | ✓ Complete |
| Hooks (HOOK) | 8/8 | ✓ Complete |
| Auth (AUTH) | 4/4 | ✓ Complete |
| UI | 9/9 | ✓ Complete |
| Deployment (DEPL) | 5/5 | ✓ Complete |

**Total:** 44/44 requirements (100%)

## Phase Verification Summary

| Phase | Status | Score | Key Evidence |
|-------|--------|-------|--------------|
| 1. Core Foundation | ✓ PASSED | 4/5 (minor gap) | 13/13 SCHM requirements, 1361 lines core code, 9 tests |
| 2. REST API Generation | ✓ PASSED | 7/7 | 5/5 API requirements, 167 lines server, 18 tests |
| 3. Query Capabilities | ✓ PASSED | 4/4 | 4/4 filter/sort/page/expand, 95 tests |
| 4. Lifecycle Hooks | ✓ PASSED | 10/10 | 8/8 HOOK requirements, 47 tests |
| 5. Admin Authentication | ✓ PASSED | 12/12 | 4/4 AUTH requirements, 40 tests |
| 6. Admin UI Records | ✓ PASSED | 5/5 | 7/9 UI requirements, React + Tailwind + shadcn |
| 7. Admin UI Schema Editor | ✓ PASSED | 3/3 | 2/9 UI requirements, runtime schema editing |
| 8. Single Binary Packaging | ✓ PASSED | 5/5 | 5/5 DEPL requirements, 56MB binary |

## Cross-Phase Integration

### Wiring Summary

| Metric | Count | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Connected exports | 28 | ✓ All properly used |
| Orphaned exports | 2 | Minor (legacy/singleton) |
| API routes consumed | 12 | ✓ All have callers |
| Protected routes | 10 | ✓ All admin routes secured |

### Phase-to-Phase Connections

| From | To | Exports | Status |
|------|----|---------:|--------|
| Phase 1 → Phase 2 | Core → API | 15 | ✓ CONNECTED |
| Phase 2 → Phase 3 | API → Query | 3 | ✓ CONNECTED |
| Phase 2 → Phase 4 | API → Hooks | 2 | ✓ CONNECTED |
| Phase 2 → Phase 5 | API → Auth | 6 | ✓ CONNECTED |
| Phase 5 → Phase 6 | Auth → UI | 3 | ✓ CONNECTED |
| Phase 6 → Phase 7 | UI → Schema | 8 | ✓ CONNECTED |
| Phase 7 → Phase 1 | Schema API → Core | 6 | ✓ CONNECTED |
| All → Phase 8 | → Binary | 2 | ✓ CONNECTED |

### Authentication Protection

All admin routes properly protected with `requireAdmin()` middleware:
- `/_/api/collections` (GET, POST)
- `/_/api/collections/:name` (PATCH, DELETE)
- `/_/api/collections/:name/fields` (GET, POST)
- `/_/api/collections/:name/fields/:fieldName` (PATCH, DELETE)
- `/_/api/auth/password` (POST)
- `/_/api/auth/me` (GET)

Public CRUD routes (`/api/collections/:name/records/*`) intentionally unprotected for external API access.

## E2E Flow Verification

| Flow | Status | Steps Verified |
|------|--------|----------------|
| 1. Developer CRUD | ✓ COMPLETE | Create collection → API endpoints → HTTP CRUD |
| 2. Admin Login | ✓ COMPLETE | Navigate /_/ → Login form → JWT → Dashboard |
| 3. Record Management | ✓ COMPLETE | Dashboard → Collection → CRUD forms |
| 4. Schema Editing | ✓ COMPLETE | Settings → Schema view → Field CRUD → Immediate effect |
| 5. Binary Deployment | ✓ COMPLETE | Build → Copy → Run → Works standalone |

## Tech Debt

### Phase 1: Core Foundation

| Item | Severity | Impact |
|------|----------|--------|
| TypeScript errors with bun:sqlite type definitions | Minor | Runtime works, only TS compilation affected |
| Success criterion wording ("via API") | Minor | Documentation issue only |

### Orphaned Exports

| Export | Location | Reason | Action |
|--------|----------|--------|--------|
| `listRecords` | src/core/records.ts | Superseded by `listRecordsWithQuery` | Consider removing in v0.2 |
| `hooks` (default) | src/core/hooks.ts | Server creates new instance | Consider removing default export |

## Test Coverage

| Phase | Tests | Status |
|-------|-------|--------|
| 1. Core Foundation | 9 | All passing |
| 2. REST API | 18 | All passing |
| 3. Query Capabilities | 95 | All passing |
| 4. Lifecycle Hooks | 47 | All passing |
| 5. Admin Authentication | 40 | All passing |
| 6. Admin UI Records | Visual verification | Passed |
| 7. Admin UI Schema Editor | Visual verification | Passed |
| 8. Single Binary | Manual verification | Passed |

**Total automated tests:** 209

## Gaps Found

**None.** All requirements satisfied, all phases verified, all integration points connected, all E2E flows complete.

## Recommendation

**PROCEED WITH MILESTONE COMPLETION**

- All 44 requirements satisfied
- All 8 phases verified
- Cross-phase integration complete
- E2E flows working
- Minor tech debt documented for future cleanup
